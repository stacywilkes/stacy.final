                <li>Another step moving forward would be to use different research designs to investigate the influence of workplace interruptions on employees.  Longitudinal designs and experimental would greatly improve our understanding of workplace interruptions.  With surveys repeatedly administered over time, researchers could better establish time precedence between work environment and strain outcomes.  They could also test whether the frequency of interruptions changes as a whole over time.  Additionally, experimental studies can also help establish causality between the work environment and strain outcomes. </li>
                <li>This measure is highly generalizable across work contexts and is not focused on one type of occupation or environment.  Discrete interruption events are correlated with the frequency measures this measure will indicate, but more importantly, the psychological state of interrupted workflow will not only be correlated with other workplace stressors, it will also predict strain outcomes that other stressors predict.</li>
                <li>However, the breaks subscale failed to behave in the predicted way, especially if conceptualized as a demand reduction strategy. </li>
                <li>The "industrial" side of I/O psychology originated in research on individual differences, assessment, and the prediction of work performance. Industrial psychology crystallized during World War I, in response to the need to rapidly assign new troops to duty. Scott and Bingham volunteered to help with the testing and placement of more than a million army recruits. In 1917, together with other prominent psychologists, they adapted a well-known intelligence test the Stanford–Binet, which was designed for testing one individual at a time, to make it suitable for group testing. The new test was called the Army Alpha.</li>
